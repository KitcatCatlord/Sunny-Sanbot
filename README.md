# Sunny-Sanbot
A reboot of the Sanbot Elf S1-B2 humanoid robot using a Raspberry Pi 5 as the AI core, with a server for more intensive tasks such as 3D navigation. It captures voice wake-words to command lightweight local LLMs, delegating heavy processing to an external server via REST APIs, and controls motors, LEDs, speech, and displays via custom drivers
